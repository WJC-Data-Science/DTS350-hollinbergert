## Case Study 2 Plots

dfa <- filter(gapminder, )


# Plot 1
#[ ] Use library(tidyverse) to load ggplot2 and dplyr and the theme_bw() to duplicate the first plot.
#[ ] Use scale_y_continuous(trans = “sqrt”) to get the correct scale on the y-axis.
#[ ] Use ggsave() and save each plot as a .png with a width of 15 inches





# Plot 2
#[ ] Build weighted average data set using weighted.mean() and GDP with summarise() and group_by() that will be the black continent average line on the second plot.
#[ ] Use theme_bw() to duplicate the second plot. You will need to use the new data to make the black lines and dots showing the continent average.
#[ ] Use ggsave() and save each plot as a .png with a width of 15 inches.
