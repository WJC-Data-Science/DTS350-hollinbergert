Team meeting notes 10/6/20
Tom served as team leader; notes were taken by Brooks

-Tom went through the visualizations from his report, identifying what results were expected and what were surprising.

-He went back to stats, and brought in a regression. Nice.

-We came to similar overall conclusions. Larger diamonds are generally more expensive, and that tends to outweigh quality factors (color, clarity).

-Lastly, we spent some time looking at the next Case Study.
