#'## Areas I could improve on.
#' 1. More efficient coding, using pipes, not using step-by-step build ups of code.
#'
#'
#'## Goals for the course and your plan to achieve those goals
#' 1.  I want to not fall behind.  It takes me a long time to code, so I need to get ahead and stay ahead as long as possible.
#' 2.  Streamline my coding, to be more efficient. USe pipes and global settings.
#' 3.  Somehow turn the rmds & htmls into classnotes, examples to use for future reference.
