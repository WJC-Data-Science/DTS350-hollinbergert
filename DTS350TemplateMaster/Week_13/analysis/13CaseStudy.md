## PLOT1 : HOUSING BUBBLE (Max vs 2010)
### This map show each state with a blue outter circle whose area equals the maximum number of annual single family permits between 1990 and 2010. 
### 1990 was chosen as a starting point because it is the bottom of the last downturn, based on Federal Reserve data.
### The inner red circle's area equals the 2010 single family permits.  The difference between the blue outter circle and the red inner circle is how far down the 2010 market is from it's highest point.
### The pop-up upon hover shows the percentage drop from Max to 2010 levels, i.e, how much the market shrank.
### The lightness or darkness of the circle is on a sliding scale to portray the percentage of drop (more percentage drop = darker circles).

## PLOT2 : EARTHQUAKES (Greater than 5.0 in the last 30 days)
### This map show each earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or greater, in the last 30 days; i.e., 2020-10-19 -- 2020-11-16.  
### The radius of the circle-marker shows the magnitude on a relative scale.  
### The circles are slightly transparent, so you can see and appreciate the build-up of successive earthquakes in the same/nearby location.
### The pop-up upon hover gives the magnitude of the quake, and an offer to click for more information.
### When the pop-up is clicked, the label provides the location, the magnitude, and the date/time of the quake.
### This interactive map is particularly interesting when you zoom in to see swarms of earthquakes in the same locale.
