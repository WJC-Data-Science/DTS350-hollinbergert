## [ ] In the previous visualization or with another visualization show which stock is helping the winner of the competition.
## **PLOT 2 : Which Stock is helping the winner of the competition?**  Separate cumulative earnings for each stock.  
## **INSIGHT 2** : The restaurant stocks (MCD and QSR) did not help either portfolio.  MCD and QSR suffered in March/April and didn't fully recover.  QSR was especially poor.  Home improvement and Department store stocks were in a tight cluster that earned around 10% over the period.
