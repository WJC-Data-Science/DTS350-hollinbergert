### DYGRAPHS DESCRIPTION : 
The dygraphs are laid out in a three tier arrangment for easy comparison of growth of a dollar, percent growth, and actual stock price.  
They are syncronized so that a zoom-in on one will automatically be reflected in the other two.
There is a Reset Zoom function that turns-on in the upper left after a zoom has occurred.
The legend has been set to width=100, so that it sits in a vertical column for easier reading.
There is a range-selector at the bottom, which is also syncronized between the three graphs.
The range selector is enlarged and has a red topline for easy "where am I" interpretation.
There is a rolling average selector in the lower left, which is initially set to 5 to help smooth the lines for easier reading.
Data lines are set to magnify when hovered on, and other datalines fade.  
There are also datadots and crosshairs that appear as the mouse hovers.  These aid in reading across to axis values associated with particular datapoints.
Grid color is set to gold, so as to not visually interfere with the datalines or the crosshairs.
The period start date is built-in via formula to the main title.  Note: In this unique case, JCPenney data is incomplete, which hampers the value-growth and percentage growth calculations.

### GGPLOT DESCRIPTION :  
Based on internet research on how to use stock sales volume to inform stock purchases, a template graph was developed.    
This template is applied to each individual stock.  These individual graphs help compare a particular stock sales volume to its share price over time.  
In order to facilitate comparison of stock price and sales volume behaviors, which are usually on vastly different numeric scales, the price and volume amounts were standardized using the "scale" function.
The graphs now show standard deviations from the mean price or mean volume on the vertical dimension.  A red horizontal zero line shows the mean.
At a glance, the reader can see whether they are above or below average price or volume, and the magnitudes are now on comparable scales.  
The daily data is very busy, so 5-day moving average lines are added, using geom_ma, in their corresponding color, but with some transparency.
Visual interpretation and professional judgment can then be applied to make a buy/don't buy recommendations.  
Patterns and relationships between Price and Volume are mentioned in https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/010702.asp and can be easily identified in the graphs.

# How to use volume to improve trading strategy
# https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/010702.asp
# KEY TAKEAWAYS
# Volume measures the number of shares traded in a stock or contracts traded in futures or options.
# Volume can be an indicator of market strength, as rising markets on increasing volume are typically viewed as strong and healthy.
# When prices fall on increasing volume, the trend is gathering strength to the downside. (BAD)
# When prices reach new highs (or no lows) on decreasing volume, watch out; a reversal might be taking shape. (BAD)
# Look for rising prices on rising volume.
# Look for reaching new price lows on decreasing volume (it will turn around)

### JCPNQ Recommendation:  Don't Buy.  They are in bankruptcy, and it's hard to tell what will happen.  Also, recent drop in prices while volume is stable.
